# Priority-Juggler
Priority Juggler is a specialized Unix-like operating system kernel built upon the EGOS-2000 architecture. The project focuses on high-efficiency process management through advanced scheduling algorithms and a modular refactoring of the Grass-layer (the kernel's hardware abstraction layer).
